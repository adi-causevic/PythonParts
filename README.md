# PythonParts Documentation

As the official documentation about different aspects of the Allplan PythonParts is far from perfect, here you can find the unofficial documentation which should fill the gaps.
This documentation is split into 4 different directories, one for each kind of topic:

- [Documentation](./Documentation)
- [Tutorials](./Tutorials)
- [Q&A](./QuestionsAndAnswers)
- [Library](./Library)

The root directory contains this file, the [index](./Index.md) file, the [how to edit](./HowToEdit.md) file and the [ToDo](./ToDo.md) file. 
In the __index__ file the current state of this repository is listed (currently it is done manually, but it could be done automatically __*#ToDo*__) so if you want to look for something, that is the place. If you want to edit or add something to this repository, first take a look at the __how to edit__ file. There you can find all the rules that have to be followed while adding to this repository. After you know how to edit, you can go to the __ToDo__ and check what has to be done.
