# PythonParts Documentation

As the official documentation about different aspects of the Allplan PythonParts is far from perfect, here you can find the unofficial documentation which should fill the gaps.
This documentation is split into 4 different directories, one for each kind of topic:

- [Documentation](./Documentation)
- [Tutorials](./Tutorials)
- [Q&A](./QuestionsAndAnswers)
- [Library](./Library)

The root directory contains [this](./README.md) file, the [index](./Index.md) file and the [how to edit](./HowToEdit.md) file. 
In the [index](./Index.md) file the current state of this repository is listed (currently it is done manually, but it could be done automatically __*#ToDo*__) so if you want to look for something, that is the place. If you want to edit or add something to this repository, first take a look at the [how to edit](./HowToEdit.md) file. There you can find all the rules that have to be followed while adding to this repository
