# Questions and Answers

This directory is the Q&A section about PythonParts. Although it would be nice if it could be used as a StackOverflow kind of Q&A service where one user asks and another answers, the main idea of this directory is to answer your own questions when you find out the ansewer that was bothering you a lot. This is a kind of short tutorial part of the repository.

## Structure

There are three main files (README, Open and General), and (hopefully) many other files.
The __README__ contains the description and some rules (At one point the local index). In the __Open__ file there are all the currently open questions that need answering. In the end, the __General__  file contains questions that have short answers.
